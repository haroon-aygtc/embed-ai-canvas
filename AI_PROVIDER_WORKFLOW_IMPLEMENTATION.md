# AI Provider Workflow Management System

## Overview

The AI Provider module has been completely redesigned to implement a proper workflow management system that ensures providers are only configured after successful API key validation and connection testing. Models are only displayed after the provider is successfully saved and models are fetched from the actual provider API.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Provider State Management

The system now tracks providers through a comprehensive state lifecycle:

```typescript
type ProviderStatus = 
  | 'unconfigured'    // No API key entered
  | 'configuring'     // API key entered, not tested
  | 'testing'         // Connection test in progress
  | 'test-failed'     // Test failed, need to retry
  | 'test-passed'     // Test passed, ready to save
  | 'saving'          // Save operation in progress
  | 'configured'      // Provider saved, ready to fetch models
  | 'fetching-models' // Fetching models from API
  | 'ready'           // Models fetched and available
  | 'error';          // General error state
```

### 2. Workflow Enforcement

#### Save Button Logic
- **Disabled by default** until connection test passes
- Only enabled when `status === 'test-passed'`
- Requires valid API key to be entered
- Shows loading state during save operation

#### Tab Visibility Logic
- **Config Tab**: Always visible
- **Models Tab**: Only visible when provider status is `configured`, `fetching-models`, or `ready`
- **Testing Tab**: Only visible when provider status is `configured` or `ready`
- **Analytics Tab**: Only visible when provider status is `ready`

### 3. Automatic Model Fetching

After successful provider save, the system automatically:
1. Fetches models from the provider's API
2. Updates provider status to `fetching-models`
3. Displays loading state in Models tab
4. Updates status to `ready` when models are loaded
5. Automatically opens Models tab

### 4. Scalable Model Display System

#### Multiple View Options
- **Grid View**: Card-based layout for browsing
- **Table View**: Compact rows for comparison

#### Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Real-time search** across model names, descriptions, and capabilities
- **Family filtering** to group related models
- **Deprecated model toggle** to show/hide deprecated models
- **Bulk selection** for batch operations

#### Model Management Features
Each model includes three toggles:
- **Save Toggle**: Store model for user's library
- **Active Toggle**: Enable model for use (requires save first)
- **Default Toggle**: Set as default model (requires active first)

### 5. Bulk Operations

#### Multi-Select Functionality
- Checkbox selection for individual models
- Select all/none functionality
- Visual feedback for selected models

#### Batch Actions
- **Save All**: Save selected models to user's library
- **Activate All**: Activate selected models (auto-saves if needed)
- **Deactivate All**: Deactivate selected models
- **Clear Selection**: Clear all selections

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Initial Configuration
1. User selects a provider from the list
2. Only Config tab is visible
3. User enters API key and configuration
4. Test Connection button becomes enabled
5. Save button remains disabled

### 2. Connection Testing
1. User clicks "Test Connection"
2. System validates API key with provider
3. Success/failure feedback is displayed
4. Save button becomes enabled on success

### 3. Provider Saving
1. User clicks "Save Provider"
2. Provider configuration is saved
3. System automatically fetches models
4. Models tab becomes visible and active

### 4. Model Management
1. Models are displayed in grid or table view
2. User can search, filter, and select models
3. Individual or bulk actions can be performed
4. Real-time feedback for all operations
